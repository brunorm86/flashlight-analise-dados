I've restructured the notebook to be optimized for PyCharm by:

1. **Using PyCharm's Cell Format**: PyCharm uses the `# %%` format for code cells and `# %% [markdown]` for markdown cells, which I've implemented throughout the notebook.

2. **Dividing Into Logical Cells**: I've broken down the analysis into smaller, focused cells that:
   - Each perform a specific task or analysis
   - Allow for step-by-step execution
   - Make debugging easier if any issues arise

3. **Organized Structure**: The notebook maintains the same comprehensive analysis flow but now with clear cell separations:
   - Setup and data loading
   - Data cleaning
   - Revenue analysis
   - Customer behavior and churn risk analysis
   - Product performance
   - Cross-selling analysis
   - Recommendations and insights
   - Executive summary
   - Dashboard preparation
   - Financial projections
   - Implementation roadmap

4. **Easy Execution**: Each cell can be executed independently in PyCharm by clicking the green "play" button that appears in the gutter next to the cell markers or by using keyboard shortcuts.

This structure makes the notebook more maintainable when working in PyCharm, as you can run and test individual code blocks without executing the entire script.
